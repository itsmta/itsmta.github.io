    <p>The <strong>Ferrari F40</strong> is one of the most iconic supercars ever made, and here's something especially cool: it was the last Ferrari personally approved by Enzo Ferrari before his passing in 1988, making it a kind of swan song for the legendary founder.
        What makes the <strong>F40</strong> particularly remarkable is its raw, no-frills design philosophy. Built to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary, it was designed for pure performance, stripped of luxuries like power steering, ABS, or even interior door handles! Everything was focused on speed and handling. 
        The <strong>F40</strong> was the first production car to exceed <strong>200 mph (324 km/h)</strong> and was powered by a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_F40>twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V8 engine producing 478 horsepower</a>. Its lightweight construction, using carbon fiber, Kevlar, and aluminum, contributed to its extraordinary performance. The car's aggressive styling, with its large rear wing and wide body, helped with aerodynamics and cooling—both critical for its performance on the track.   
        It’s a car that's raw, visceral, and truly built for the driving purist.</p>
